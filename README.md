CI/CD Pipeline for a Web App on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of a web application to an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu).
The pipeline ensures smooth integration, testing, and deployment of web app updates, minimizing downtime and reducing manual steps.
🚀 Features

    Continuous Integration (CI):

        Automatically build and test code changes upon each Git push or pull request.

        Ensures code quality and prevents faulty deployments.

    Continuous Deployment (CD):

        Deploys the latest approved build to AWS EC2 Ubuntu server.

        Ensures consistent and repeatable deployments.

    Environment Management:

        Secure use of environment variables and secrets.

        Rollback mechanism in case of failed deployments.

    Scalability & Maintainability:

        Designed to scale across environments (dev, staging, production).

        Clear logging, monitoring, and error handling.

🏗️ Architecture

    Version Control: GitHub / GitLab

    CI/CD Tooling: GitHub Actions / Jenkins (choose based on project setup)

    Build Process: Node.js / Python / Java (customize as per your web app stack)

    Hosting Environment: AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)

    Deployment Automation: SSH + shell scripts, or Ansible/Terraform (optional)

⚙️ Prerequisites

Before setting up the pipeline, ensure you have:

    An AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance with:

        Security group allowing HTTP/HTTPS and SSH access.

        Nginx/Apache (if needed) or custom app runtime installed.

    Docker (optional, if containerization is used).

    Git for version control.

    CI/CD tool configured (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins).

    SSH key-based access set up between CI/CD system and EC2.

⚡ Setting Up the Pipeline
1️⃣ Clone Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ci-cd-webapp-aws-ec2.git
cd ci-cd-webapp-aws-ec2

2️⃣ Configure Application

    Update configurations in scripts/deploy.sh (server IP, app directory, etc.).

    Set environment variables (DB credentials, API keys) securely in CI/CD tool.

3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline Setup
GitHub Actions Example

    Add a workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml):

        Runs on push to main branch.

        Installs dependencies, runs tests.

        Deploys build to EC2 via SSH.

Jenkins Example

    Use Jenkinsfile with stages for build, test, and deploy.

    Configure credentials in Jenkins for SSH access to EC2.

4️⃣ Deployment

Once code is pushed to main:

    Pipeline triggers automatically.

    Tests run to ensure code stability.

    If successful, app is deployed to EC2 Ubuntu server.

    App is accessible via the EC2 public IP / domain name.

🛠️ Deployment Script Example (deploy.sh)

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting deployment..."

# Variables
APP_DIR="/var/www/webapp"
REPO="https://github.com/username/ci-cd-webapp-aws-ec2.git"

# Update system and application
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip << EOF
    cd $APP_DIR || git clone $REPO $APP_DIR
    cd $APP_DIR
    git pull origin main
    npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt
    pm2 restart all || pm2 start src/app.js --name webapp
EOF

echo "Deployment finished successfully!"

🔒 Security Considerations

    Use AWS IAM roles and policies for limited-access credentials.

    Store SSH keys and secrets securely in CI/CD platform’s secret manager.

    Enable firewall rules and restrict open ports.

    Regularly update Ubuntu system and app dependencies.

📊 Monitoring & Logging

    Use CloudWatch / ELK Stack / Prometheus-Grafana for monitoring.

    Log application and deployment output for debugging.

✅ Future Enhancements

    Add Blue-Green or Rolling Deployments.

    Containerize application with Docker + ECS/EKS.

    Add automated rollback policy on failure.

    Use Terraform or Ansible for full infrastructure automation.
